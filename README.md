# Technology Economics

This repository contains various production functions commonly used in microeconomics implemented in Python. It explores the behavior of input decisions, expenditure shares, and output prices in response to changes in input prices. The production functions implemented in this repository include Perfect Complements, Perfect Substitutes, Cobb-Douglas, and CES.

## Production Functions

1. **Perfect Complements**: This production function represents a scenario where inputs are used in fixed proportions. It explores how changes in input prices affect input decisions, expenditure shares, and output prices.

2. **Perfect Substitutes**: This production function assumes that inputs are completely substitutable for each other. The repository investigates the impact of input price changes on input decisions, expenditure shares, and output prices under this scenario.

3. **Cobb-Douglas**: The Cobb-Douglas production function is widely used in economics. It combines inputs using a specific functional form, and this repository examines the effects of input price changes on input decisions, expenditure shares, and output prices within this framework.

4. **CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution)**: The CES production function allows for varying degrees of substitutability between inputs. It is a flexible function that encompasses other production functions as special cases. The repository analyzes the behavior of input decisions, expenditure shares, and output prices when input prices change under the CES framework.

## How to Use

To use the production functions implemented in this repository with Python, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/franc703/technology_economics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd technology_economics
   ```

3. Explore the production function files (`*.py`) to understand their implementation and mathematical representation.

4. Install the required Python dependencies using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Use your preferred Python IDE or text editor to open the production function file you want to work with.

6. Modify the input values and input prices as required in the file.

7. Run the Python script and observe the output to gain insights into the behavior of input decisions, expenditure shares, and output prices under different scenarios.
